### Winning and Losing

For the player to win, they must defeat the Golem boss. Defeating the boss allows the player to reach the next rest point, which is the end of the game.

To lose, players must die during combat by reaching zero health. Death is not permanent, as players will respawn at their last save. Thus, players can learn from their mistakes and try again.
